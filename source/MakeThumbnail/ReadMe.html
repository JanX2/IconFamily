<h3><a name="purpose">Purpose</a></h3>

<p>&ldquo;IconFamily&rdquo; is a Cocoa/Objective-C wrapper for Mac&nbsp;OS&nbsp;X <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Carbon/Reference/IconServices/icon_services/function_group_19.html">Icon Services</a>&rsquo; &ldquo;IconFamily&rdquo; data type.  Its main purpose is to enable Cocoa applications to easily assign custom file icons from NSImage instances.  Using the IconFamily class you can:</p>

<ul>

<li>create a multi-representation icon family from any arbitrary NSImage</li>

<li>assign an icon family as a file's custom icon resource, so it will appear in Finder views</li>

<li>read and write .icns files</li>

<li>copy icon data to and from the scrap (pasteboard)</li>

<li>get and set the elements of an icon family in convenient, Cocoa-compatible
NSBitmapImageRep form</li>

</ul>

<p>The IconFamily code started out as a small experiment that yielded a modest bit of code that has since found its way into a gratifying number of <a href="#clients">applications</a>.  It's extensively commented, so extending it further and fixing problems should be pretty easy.  I welcome <a href="mailto:troy_stephens@mac.com">contributions, suggestions, and feedback</a> that will help to improve it futher.</p>

<p>The included Xcode project builts a simple Cocoa testbed app called &ldquo;MakeThumbnail&rdquo; that demonstrates basic use of the IconFamily class.  MakeThumbnail lets you open any NSImage-supported image file and re-save it as either a JPEG image with a custom file icon, or an .icns file with the same icon data assigned as the file's custom icon.</p>

<p>I've also posted a Universal Binary (Intel/PPC) build of the sample project: <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/troy_stephens/software/objects/IconFamily/MakeThumbnail-0.9.zip">MakeThumbnail-0.9.zip</a></p>

<h3><a name="credits">Credits/Contributors</a></h3>

<p>I'm grateful to a number of talented and generous people for enhancements, bug fixes, and feedback that have helped improve the IconFamily code over the years.  <i>Thanks, guys!</i></p>

<p><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/tschnitzer/">Thomas Schnitzer</a> provided contributions to the icon family element extraction code, and valuable help in understanding the related Carbon APIs, that made the initial releases possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ittpoi.com">David Remahl</a>, author of <a href="http://www.ittpoi.com/cci.html">Can Combine Icons</a>, generously
donated his own extensions to the IconFamily class for the 0.3 and 0.4.x
releases.  <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/nathan_day/">Nathan Day</a> has
likewise helped fix bugs and has contributed useful extensions, in the course
of using the IconFamily code to build Popup Dock.  Ben Haller, proprietor of
<a href="http://www.sticksoftware.com">Stick Software</a>, pitched in his own
contributions and dedication to get the 0.4 release of IconFamily out the
door.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:mike@sugarcubesoftware.com">Mike Margolis</a>, author of <a href="http://sugarcubesoftware.com">Sugar Cube Software</a>'s <a href="http://sugarcubesoftware.com/sw/index.php?pic2icon">Pic2Icon</a> tool,
has contributed support for creating shadowed, dog-eared document-like
thumbnail icons that I've been meaning for a good long while now to fold into a future release.  (Sorry, Mike!)</p>


<h3><a name="clients">Applications that use IconFamily</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> saves each document with a thumbnail snapshot as its custom file icon.  Omni has folded the IconFamily source into its freely available <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/developer/sourcecode/">OmniAppKit</a> framework.</p>

<p>Stone Design's <a href="http://www.stone.com/Create/Create.html">Create</a> also uses the IconFamily code to provide thumbnail snapshots for saved documents.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ittpoi.com">David Remahl</a> built on
the IconFamily class to create <a href="http://ittpoi.com/index.php?product=com.ittpoi.cancombineicons&amp;type=frameset">Can Combine Icons</a>, an
elegant Cocoa-based Mac OS X application that makes short work of
compositing icons to create new ones.</p>

<p>Martin Wengenmayer's <a href="http://www.cheetah3d.com">Cheetah3D</a> uses IconFamily to save thumbnail icons for rendered images (specify an explicit extension, such as &ldquo;.tiff&rdquo;, when saving), and can be used as a tool for 
creating custom icons from 3D models (see &ldquo;Making Mac OS X Icons&rdquo; in the accompanying documentation).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eazydraw.biz/">EazyDraw</a> uses IconFamily to save documents with thumbnail icons, and to support creating .icns files.</p>

<p>Marc Moini's <a href="http://www.marcmoini.com/f3_en.html">3D-Finder</a> and <a href="http://www.marcmoini.com/sx_en.html">Smart Scroll X</a> use IconFamily for their custom icon manipulation needs.</p>

<p>The bitmap manipulation code in <a href="http://www.loos.li/trollin/index.html">Trollin</a>'s <a href="http://www.loos.li/trollin/index.html#iconCompo">iconCompo</a>,
another versatile icon compositing tool, was influenced by the IconFamily
source.</p>

<p>Thomas Schnitzer's <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/tschnitzer/">Iconizer</a> lets you zoom and
drag-select to choose specific regions of your images from which to create
thumbnail icons.</p>

<p><a href="http://sugarcubesoftware.com">Sugar Cube Software</a>'s
free <a href="http://sugarcubesoftware.com/sw/index.php?pic2icon">Pic2Icon</a>
leverages the IconFamily class, enabling you to create thumbnails for
image files with drag-and-drop simplicity.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sticksoftware.com">Stick Software</a>'s <a href="http://www.sticksoftware.com/software/Constrictor.html">Constrictor</a>
screen grab utility and <a href="http://www.sticksoftware.com/software/Fracture.html">Fracture</a> screen
saver use the IconFamily class to provide thumbnail icons for saved screen
snapshots and fractal images.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gideonsoftworks.com">Gideon Softworks'</a> <a href="http://www.gideonsoftworks.com/filexaminer.html">FileXaminer</a>
(a Finder "Get Info" enhancement) uses IconFamily to support custom
icon assignments.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.extraneous.us">Extraneous
Software</a>'s <a href="http://www.extraneous.us/software/LameSecure/About.html">LameSecure</a>,
a lightweight security tool, reportedly uses IconFamily somewhere, for
something or other. :-)</p>



<h3><a name="history">Version History</a></h3>

<p><span class="newsdate">Version 0.9 - March 9, 2006</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed byte order handling in <tt>-bitmapImageRepWithAlphaForIconFamilyElement:</tt> to work correctly on Intel</li>
<li>Replaced all usage of the deprecated <tt>FSSpec</tt> type with appropriate calls and use of <tt>FSRef</tt></li>
<li>Fixed build warnings that appeared on Tiger, and removed some old cruft</li>
<li>Updated project file to Xcode 2.2</li>
<li>Tested under Mac OS X 10.4.5, on both Intel and PPC hardware</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="newsdate">Version 0.5.1 - March 5, 2004</span><br />
Minor changes to fix two warnings that appeared when compiling IconFamily 0.5 on Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther):</p>

<ul>
<li>Replaced occurrences of <tt>'????'</tt> with <tt>kUnknownType</tt></li>
<li>Disambiguated order of operations in expressions involving <tt>*pRawBitmapData++</tt></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="newsdate">Version 0.5 - August 6, 2002</span><br />
Updated for compatibility with Mac OS X 10.2:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fixed <tt>-init</tt> method so it works on both 10.1.x and 10.2</li>

<li>Added calls to <tt>FNNotify()</tt> to improve Finder synchronization</li>

</ul>

<p>Applications that rely on the <tt>-init</tt> method that was added in
Version 0.4 should be recompiled with this new version of the IconFamily
class for compatibility with Mac OS X 10.2.</p>

<p><span class="newsdate">Version 0.4.1 - May 2, 2002</span><br />
Released within hours of 0.4, this version fixed the omission of two new
methods submitted by David Remahl:</p>

<ul>

<li><tt>-setAsCustomIconForDirectory:</tt></li>

<li><tt>-setAsCustomIconForDirectory:withCompatibility:</tt></li>

</ul>

<p>There is also a new method in the "CarbonFSSpecCreation" category on
NSString, which permits getting an <tt>FSRef</tt> for a given path.  The prior
method to get an <tt>FSSpec</tt> is now implemented in terms of this
method.</p>

<p><span class="newsdate">Version 0.4 - May 2, 2002</span><br />
Nathan Day, Ben Haller, and David Remahl contributed new features and bug
fixes for the 0.4 release, including:</p>

<ul>

<li>fixes for the <tt>-init</tt> and <tt>-setAsCustomIconOfFile:</tt>
methods</li>

<li>a new <tt>+removeCustomIconFromFile:</tt> class method</li>

<li>support for creating 8-bit indexed-color icon family elements</li>

<li>respect for exiting type/creator codes in
<tt>-setAsCustomIconForFile:...</tt> A new "compatibility" parameter to this
method causes "large" and "small" 8-bit images and their 1-bit masks to be
stored as independent resources in addition to being stored as members of the
icon family resource</li>

<li>a fix for <tt>-writeToFile:</tt> (previously there was a problem with
certain kinds of paths)</li>

<li>a probably more efficient alternative to going through <tt>-tiffData</tt>
to get bitmap image representations in
<tt>-initWithThumbnailsOfImage:usingImageInterpolation:</tt></li>

</ul>

<p>Special thanks to Ben for folding his and David's changes into a
ready-to-go 0.4 release!</p>

<p>I've also fixed a potential divide-by-zero error in
<tt>+get32BitdataFromBitmapImageRep:</tt>.</p>

<p><span class="newsdate">Version 0.3 - January 26, 2002</span><br />
David Remahl contributed a number of useful extensions and fixes for this
release, including:</p>

<ul>

<li>new init methods for creating an IconFamily from a standard system
icon, from the Finder icon of a specified file, or from the Carbon
Scrap Manager (Cocoa Pasteboard)</li>

<li>a <tt>-putOnScrap</tt> method for placing a copy of an IconFamily on
the Scrap (Pasteboard)</li>

<li>code to undo the effects of premultiplied alpha in <tt>get32BitDataFromBitmapImageRep:</tt></li>

<li>a fix for 1-bit mask generation</li>

</ul>

<p>Mike Margolis and David Remahl jointly suggested the use of
NSGraphicsContext's <tt>-setImageInterpolation:</tt> method to specify the
resampling algorithm to use.  By default, the IconFamily class now uses
<tt>NSImageInterpolationHigh</tt>, which produces higher-quality thumbnails
than previous versions of the code, but you can easily choose from among
<tt>Default/None/Low/High</tt>.</p>

<p>I added an accessory view to MakeThumbnail's "Save" panel to facilitate
experimenting with the various <tt>NSImageInterpolation...</tt> settings that
are now available.  I've also added generation of "small" (16x16) icons, fixed
memory leaks, and fixed a bug that affected the display size of the loaded
image in the MakeThumbnail example under Mac OS X 10.0 and later versions.</p>

<p>IconFamily 0.3 has been tested on Mac OS X 10.1.2, using the December 2001
Developer Tools.</p>

<p><span class="newsdate">Version 0.2 - April 25, 2001</span><br />
This release fixed a bug in the -bitmapImageRepWithAlphaForIconFamilyElement:
method, where the NSBitmapImageRep's data was being referenced instead of
copied and retained (sometimes resulting in a damaged bitmap or one containing
random garbage).
</p>

<p>
I also added an init method for creating an IconFamily from an existing
IconFamilyHandle, and removed the warnings about post-Public Beta Mac OS X
compatibility, since the code appeared to work just fine on Mac OS X 10.0.
</p>

<p><span class="newsdate">Version 0.1 alpha - February 28, 2001</span><br />
First public release.</p>
